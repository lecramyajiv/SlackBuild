# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsoxr: libsoxr (The SoX Resampler library)
libsoxr: The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate conversion
libsoxr: it may be used,for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio. Libsoxr provides a simple
libsoxr: API that allows interfacing using the most commonly-used sample formats and buffering schemes,
libsoxr: for real-time resampling, libsoxr may have a higher latency than non-FFT based resamplers.
