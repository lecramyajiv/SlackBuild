Some experiences in dealing with packages in slackware

1. Do not install libguestfs in slackware it messes up the system
2. If your using cpan do not run as a $USER.
3. If you want to install perl or ocaml modules try to build a slackbuild first it would be better and it 
won't balloon up the system.
4. Same goes with python modules only use pip as a last resort.
